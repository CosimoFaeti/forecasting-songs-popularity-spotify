# Forecasting Songs Popularity Spotify  
This repository contains my project for the *Statistical Learning course* of my Erasmus Exchange program at NTNU (Norwegian University of Science and Technology).
Performed regression task by predicting song popularity based on its features using
regularized linear models and tree-based/ensemble methods implemented in R. Achieved the best Mean Squared
Error (MSE) score on the test set using Bagging and Random Forest techniques.

## Repository Overview
In this repository, in the root level, you can find the pdf version of the report, the data and the code for the implementation of machine learning models for song popularity spotify data set. More specifically:

**Compulsory Exercise 1**:
* Compulsory1.R : contains compulsory exercise 1

**Compulsory Exercise 2**:
* Compulsory2..Rmd : contains descriptive data analysis and the implementation of regularized linear models (multiple linear regression, and some regularization approaches such as lasso, ridge and polynomial), tree-based methods (regression tree), and ensemble methods (bagging, random forest and boosting)
